# Div I R package idea

> Please describe a preliminary idea for an R package. 
> My main idea for an R package in my final project is one to compile release and character information for the conjuring series. Kasey and I have been working on developing this idea together.


# Div II proposal

> Please describe the R package that you plan to develop for Div III. Is it a new package? Or is it a substantial revision of an existing package? What will it do? Why will it be useful? Who would use it? What features will it have? 

> For our final project, we will create a package comprised of Pokémon-related datasets. The primary dataset is a spin-off of the Pokédex, an organizational tool that details information about each of the hundreds of Pokémon, allowing users to access the relevant data with ease. It will include facts about each Pokémon, such as name, type, species, abilities, catch rate, growth rate, sex breakdown, and evolution information. We won’t include all the categories from the original Pokédex in the package; we have selected what we consider the most commonly used, and therefore the most relevant, variables. We will begin with a limited list of about 20 Pokémon initially, though we plan to expand it to all Pokémon. We haven’t decided on what the other datasets will be exactly, but our ideas include one about the different regions, listing the different Pokémon you can capture on each of the regions’ routes, as well as those available by other means in the game, like breeding. Another potential idea is a list of all the possible moves and their stats and which Pokémon can learn them. We could also make generation-specific datasets, as some minor details differ between generations (plus some Pokémon weren’t available until later generations). We aim to have 2-3 datasets at minimum, if not more, time permitting.
While there are other Pokémon-related packages (most notably [Rokemon](https://github.com/schochastics/Rokemon)), they only have a Pokédex-based dataset, whereas ours will be more extensive. Our goal for this package is to create a design that allows users to view and easily interact with Pokémon-related data without needing to collect it themselves because no such package currently exists (to our knowledge). Our package can help create visualizations to compare different types of Pokémon, demonstrating evolution charts, examining the prevalence of particular attack or defense moves, and more. Our project will allow Pokémon enthusiasts and those hunting for datasets to perform Pokémon-related data analysis more smoothly.
