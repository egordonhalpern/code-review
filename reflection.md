# Div I statement

> Describe your programming development during Div I. What new things have you learned? How have you grown as a programmer? How has your understanding of R changed? 

>I came into SDS 270 very anxious, as I have minimal experience with R. Throughout the course so far, I feel like I've developed my acceptance of being wrong rather than my R skills. I've had a really hard time so far this semester, especially in regard to personal struggles, and I have found it difficult to fully keep up. That being said, I do have more resources to address errors in my code and I feel eons more comfortable reaching out for help. I think that, while I don't feel like a particularly advanced programmer, I am comfortable using the resources that I have to continue to improve, and I look forward to growing more as the course continues.


# Div II statement

> Describe your programming development during Div II. What new things have you learned? How have you grown as a programmer? How has your understanding of R changed? 

>Working on Div II the past few weeks has been really beneficial to my programming experience, particularly in regards to problem solving and communication. Working with a group has helped me to think slowly and calmly about errors and confusion, and to be more thoughtful with how I contribute to the group as an individual. 
My group member Abbie has been really patient and helpful in showing me the ropes of github more in depth, and I now feel confident with making commits and pushing/pulling, as well as having a better understanding of the communication required to avoid merge conflicts. Working on this project has also helped me gain experience in creating packages in R; I feel more confident now with hands-on experience than with theoretical knowledge from the book. I worked primarily on creating the README.Rmd and DESCRIPTION for our project and now have a much better understanding of both R and github. I am still feeling a little unsure, but know that I have the means to handle any complications thrown my way.
