# Div I statement

> Describe your programming development during Div I. What new things have you learned? How have you grown as a programmer? How has your understanding of R changed? 

>I came into SDS 270 very anxious, as I have minimal experience with R. Throughout the course so far, I feel like I've developed my acceptance of being wrong rather than my R skills. I've had a really hard time so far this semester, especially in regard to personal struggles, and I have found it difficult to fully keep up. That being said, I do have more resources to address errors in my code and I feel eons more comfortable reaching out for help. I think that, while I don't feel like a particularly advanced programmer, I am comfortable using the resources that I have to continue to improve, and I look forward to growing more as the course continues.


# Div II statement

> Describe your programming development during Div II. What new things have you learned? How have you grown as a programmer? How has your understanding of R changed? 

>Working on Div II the past few weeks has been really beneficial to my programming experience, particularly in regards to problem solving and communication. Working with a group has helped me to think slowly and calmly about errors and confusion, and to be more thoughtful with how I contribute to the group as an individual. 
My group member Abbie has been really patient and helpful in showing me the ropes of github more in depth, and I now feel confident with making commits and pushing/pulling, as well as having a better understanding of the communication required to avoid merge conflicts. Working on this project has also helped me gain experience in creating packages in R; I feel more confident now with hands-on experience than with theoretical knowledge from the book. I worked primarily on creating the README.Rmd and DESCRIPTION for our project and now have a much better understanding of both R and github. I am still feeling a little unsure, but know that I have the means to handle any complications thrown my way.


# Div III statement

> Describe your programming development during Div III. What new things have you learned? How have you grown as a programmer? How has your understanding of R changed? 

>This semester has vastly reshaped my understanding of R, as well as the ways in which we can use it collaboratively. I spoke in my last reflection about how much more comfortable I've become with Github, and I think that comfort has really been starting to cross over into R programming as well. Working on this project has required me to think more critically about the code that I'm running: What is this saying? Why am I running it? Is this the best way to acheive my intended goal? I've thought more about the actual meaning behind the code more in this semester than the rest of my academic career in its entirety. I feel a lot more grounded in my understanding of what "map" is doing, for example, rather than simply copying code from a lecture slide and holding my breath that it runs smoothly because I probably wouldn't have read the warning message, and for errors I would panic without really considering the explanation given directly to me by R. I'm getting a lot better at using the tools in front of me and thinking fully about the compilcations that programming presents.
One tool in particular that really helped me this semester was the group format. Abbie specifically was phenomenal, and acted almost like a TA for groupmates and others. When I was feeling lost, overwhelmed, and unsure of where to start, she gave explanations behind her code (why she was using the numbers and functions that she was) and it was really helpful for me as we started working. She really helped to enhance the learning environment that you had created for us.
>There was a point during the semester where I didn't think I'd be able to finish it, at least not without a 2-week medical leave, and I'm really proud of the work that I did despite that. Overall, I feel really good about my progress this semester.
